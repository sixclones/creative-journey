## Raymarching

### Distance functions

Here you will find the distance functions for basic primitives, plus the formulas for combining them together for building more complex shapes, as well as some distortion functions that you can use to shape your objects. Hopefully this will be useful for those rendering scenes with raymarching.

## What is this and how it works?

This page is a list of links that helped me or that I find interesting.<br>
There is a lot of resources that exist and that are not there because I didn't find them interesting or I simply didn't read them. So there might be things that seems intential to you that are "missing" here.<br>
This is not planned to be exhaustive.

It is split into different parts that are sorted alphabetically, into each parts the links are also sorted alphabetically.<br>
The list is updated every months. There is no need to suggest me things to add.

# Creative Journey

Since I started to code, I was interested by using computers to make creative and artistic things. This is a page where I share resources (articles, videos, tutorials etc.) that helped me.

> You can find a section on how it works at [the bottom of this page](#what-is-this-and-how-it-works).

## Notes

A quick note on the difference between [*Creative coding section*](#creative-coding) and [*Generative art section*](#generative-art) and why I splited things in two parts. I make a distinction between those two terms as I wanted to have a section more dedicated to the coding tricks and another one more oriented on the thinking behing doing art. So you might find some articles titled "Doing this with generative art" in *Creative coding* because it's a technical breakdown of a process or an effect. So this part might be view as "Doing creative and artistic things with code" and the other one like "Thoughts about (generative) art".

## What is this and how it works?

This page is a list of links that helped me or that I find interesting.<br>
There is a lot of resources that exist and that are not there because I didn't find them interesting or I simply didn't read them. So there might be things that seems intential to you that are "missing" here.<br>
This is not planned to be exhaustive.

As creative developer or generative artist we are dealing with code and everything that comes with. Including the most technical part like languages or versionning. So on this page you might find some links that are not direclty relatable to creative things but that you might need one day or another.

It is split into different parts that are sorted alphabetically, into each parts the links are also sorted alphabetically.<br>
The list is updated every months. There is no need to suggest me things to add.
